# What are lambda expressions?
lambda expressions in Python are best described as ***single-use anonymous functions***. What I mean by this, can be explained with a quick example.
```python
[1,2,3,4,5]
```
I have this list of numbers that I want to square (multiply by itself). I could create a function like so.
```python
def square(number):
    return number*number
```

This works fine, but what if you only need to do this one time? It would be a little cumbersome to have a function dedicated to this pretty menial task. We can use a lambda express for this instead.

```python
lambda number: number*number
```
So you can see what's happening by referencing the above function next to our lambda expression. We declare `lambda` so the interpreter knows this is a lambda express. The first item is then the parameter which replaces the `number` argument in the `square()` function. Next is the actual result of the expression, `number*number`.

Here's an example using `map()` to get the squared result of each number in our list.
```python
list(map(lambda number: number*number, numbers))
> [1,4,9,16,25]
```

I hope this is a good example to help you grasp lambda expressions so you can avoid huge pages of disposable functions!
